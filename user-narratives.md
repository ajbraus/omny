## Orus the Orderer

I want to attend a meetup in SF but I am in Katmandu. I find the beomny app, login through 
facebook, and I select that the robot should be delivered to the location of the meetup 
using a map like Lyft or Uber. Next I confirm and I'm prompted to pay with Apple Pay or 
to add a credit card. I select apple pay. I receive an email that allows me too schedule
it on my calendar. I can cancel up until 24 hours before the event. After that I only get
at 50% refund. I pay a $25 deliver/pickup fee and $80/hour, so my total will be ~$200 for
two hours at this meetup.

## Dale the Driver

I receive an email 28 hours before my drive, and a push notification two hours before, 
and then a push notification when the drive starts. I open up the app and I start the drive.
I see where the robot is on google maps and I am already in the building where the meetup
is happening. I come online and start to drive around from my phone. I have a great time and
meet some good contacts. I'm given a 15 min warning, and then a 5 minute warning. I can
extend my usage, no prob! I extend another 30 min for $40. Then I'm done. I end the drive.
Close the app.
